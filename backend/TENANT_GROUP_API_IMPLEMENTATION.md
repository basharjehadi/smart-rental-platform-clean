# üë• Tenant Group API Implementation - Group Management Flow

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Tenant Group API with a complete group management flow that allows users to create tenant groups, invite members, manage group membership, and handle group ownership transfers.

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. **TenantGroupController** ‚úÖ
**File**: `src/controllers/tenantGroupController.js`

#### **Core Methods**:
- **`createTenantGroup`** - Create new tenant group with current user as primary
- **`inviteUserToGroup`** - Invite user to join tenant group by email
- **`acceptGroupInvitation`** - Accept invitation to join tenant group
- **`getGroupMembers`** - View all members of a tenant group
- **`getMyTenantGroup`** - Get current user's tenant group details
- **`updateTenantGroup`** - Update group details (primary members only)
- **`leaveTenantGroup`** - Leave tenant group
- **`transferPrimaryMembership`** - Transfer ownership to another member

#### **Key Features**:
- **Primary Member System**: Designates group leaders with special permissions
- **Invitation System**: Email-based invitation system (notification support planned)
- **Role Management**: Primary members can manage group and transfer ownership
- **Data Integrity**: Proper validation and constraint checking
- **Comprehensive Access Control**: Members can only access their own groups

### 2. **Tenant Group Routes** ‚úÖ
**File**: `src/routes/tenantGroupRoutes.js`

#### **Available Endpoints**:
```
POST   /api/tenant-groups                           - Create new tenant group
GET    /api/tenant-groups/my-group                  - Get user tenant group
POST   /api/tenant-groups/:id/invite                - Invite user to group
POST   /api/tenant-groups/:id/accept                - Accept group invitation
GET    /api/tenant-groups/:id/members               - View group members
PUT    /api/tenant-groups/:id                       - Update group details
DELETE /api/tenant-groups/:id/leave                 - Leave group
POST   /api/tenant-groups/:id/transfer-ownership   - Transfer ownership
```

#### **Security Features**:
- **Authentication Required**: All routes protected with `verifyToken` middleware
- **Group-Level Access**: Users can only access groups they're members of
- **Primary Member Permissions**: Only primary members can update group details and transfer ownership

### 3. **Route Registration** ‚úÖ
**File**: `src/routes/index.js`
- Successfully integrated tenant group routes into main application
- Available at `/api/tenant-groups/*` path

## üîß Tenant Group Management Flow

### **Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Group Creation**
   - User creates new tenant group with a name
   - User automatically becomes the primary member
   - Group is ready for member invitations

2. **Member Invitation**
   - Primary members can invite users by email
   - System validates user exists and isn't already in a group
   - Invitation is prepared (notification system integration planned)

3. **Invitation Acceptance**
   - Invited users can accept and join the group
   - New members are added as non-primary members
   - Group membership is established

4. **Group Management**
   - Primary members can update group details
   - Primary members can transfer ownership to other members
   - All members can view group information and other members

5. **Member Departure**
   - Members can leave the group
   - Primary members can't leave if they're the only primary
   - Ownership transfer required before last primary can leave
