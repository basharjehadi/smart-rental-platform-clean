## 🔄 2-Stage Review Process

### Stage 1: Move-in Experience
- **Trigger**: When tenant moves into the property
- **Weight**: **0%** of total rating (no score impact)
- **Purpose**: Evaluate property condition, move-in process, and initial interactions
- **Reviewers**: Both landlord and tenant review each other
- **Label**: "Move-in check (no score impact)"

### Stage 2: Lease End
- **Trigger**: When lease term expires
- **Weight**: **40%** of total rating
- **Purpose**: Assess overall experience, property maintenance, and relationship quality
- **Reviewers**: Both landlord and tenant review each other
- **Label**: "Lease end review (affects score)"

### Stage Progression
```
New User (5.0) → Move-in Stage → Lease End Stage
     ↓              ↓              ↓
Initial Rating → Updated Rating → Final Rating
```

---

## ⭐ Rating System & Calculations

### Initial Rating
- **New Users**: Automatically receive **5.0 stars**
- **Reason**: Provides a starting point for new accounts
- **Duration**: Until first real review is submitted

### Weighted Rating Formula
```
Final Rating = (Move-in × 0.00) + (Lease End × 0.40)
```

**Note**: Move-in reviews are excluded from score calculations and only provide feedback without affecting user ratings.

### Example Calculation
```
User receives:
- Move-in Stage: 4 stars (4 × 0.00 = 0.0) - No score impact
- Lease End: 3 stars (3 × 0.40 = 1.2)

Final Rating = 0.0 + 1.2 = 3.0 stars (based only on lease end review)
```

### Rating Updates
- **Real-time**: Ratings update immediately after review submission
- **Cumulative**: Each stage builds upon previous ratings
- **Persistent**: Ratings remain even if users delete accounts

## 🤖 Review Publisher Job

### Overview
The Review Publisher Job is an automated system that runs hourly to publish reviews based on specific criteria. It ensures that reviews are published at the right time and updates user ratings and ranks accordingly.

### Job Schedule
- **Frequency**: Every hour at minute 0 (e.g., 1:00, 2:00, 3:00, etc.)
- **Timezone**: UTC for consistency across all deployments
- **Duration**: Typically completes within a few seconds

### Publishing Criteria

#### 1. Review Pair Publishing
**Trigger**: When both reviews for the same lease and stage are in `SUBMITTED` status

**What Happens**:
1. System identifies lease/stage combinations with 2+ submitted reviews
2. All reviews in the pair are published simultaneously
3. Status changes from `SUBMITTED` → `PUBLISHED`
4. `publishedAt` timestamp is set to current time
5. `computeUserAggregate()` is called for each target tenant group

**Example**:
```
Lease: ABC-123, Stage: MOVE_IN
├── Review 1: Tenant → Landlord (SUBMITTED)
└── Review 2: Landlord → Tenant (SUBMITTED)
↓
Both reviews published simultaneously
```

#### 2. Single Review Publishing
**Trigger**: When `publishAfter` ≤ current time

**What Happens**:
1. System finds reviews with expired `publishAfter` timestamps
2. Individual reviews are published one by one
3. Status changes from `SUBMITTED` → `PUBLISHED`
4. `publishedAt` timestamp is set to current time
5. `computeUserAggregate()` is called for the target tenant group

**Example**:
```
Review: XYZ-789
├── Status: SUBMITTED
├── publishAfter: 2024-01-15T10:00:00Z
└── Current time: 2024-01-15T11:00:00Z
↓
Review published (publishAfter has passed)
```

### User Aggregate Computation

After publishing reviews, the system automatically:

1. **Calculates Average Rating**: Computes weighted average from all published reviews
2. **Updates User Records**: Sets new `averageRating` and `totalReviews` values
3. **Recalculates User Ranks**: Calls `rankService.calculateUserRank()` for all affected users
4. **Maintains Data Consistency**: Ensures ratings and ranks stay synchronized

### Job Statistics

The system provides real-time statistics about review processing:

```json
{
  "totalReviews": 150,
  "pendingReviews": 25,
  "submittedReviews": 15,
  "publishedReviews": 100,
  "blockedReviews": 10
}
```

## 📊 Review Aggregates Service

### Overview
The Review Aggregates Service provides sophisticated time-weighted calculations for user ratings based on published `END_OF_LEASE` reviews. This service ensures that recent reviews have more impact on user ratings while maintaining historical context.

### Core Functionality

#### Time-Weighted Rating Calculation
The service implements a sophisticated weighting system for `END_OF_LEASE` reviews:

- **Recent Reviews (0-12 months)**: **60% weight**
- **Medium Reviews (13-24 months)**: **30% weight**
- **Old Reviews (25+ months)**: **10% weight**

#### Rating Threshold
- **Minimum Reviews**: Users need at least **3 reviews** to receive a calculated average
- **Below Threshold**: Returns `null` for `averageRating` if total reviews < 3
- **Above Threshold**: Calculates weighted average and stores it

### API Functions

#### `computeUserAggregate(userId: string)`
**Purpose**: Computes time-weighted average rating for a specific user

**Process**:
1. Fetches all published `END_OF_LEASE` reviews for the user
2. Applies time-based weighting (60%/30%/10%)
3. Calculates weighted average if ≥3 reviews
4. Updates user record with new `averageRating` and `totalReviews`
5. Returns comprehensive aggregate result

**Returns**:
```typescript
interface UserAggregateResult {
  userId: string;
  averageRating: number | null;
  totalReviews: number;
  weightedScore: number;
  lastReviewDate: Date | null;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

#### `getUserAggregateSummary(userId: string)`
**Purpose**: Provides detailed breakdown of user's review distribution

**Returns**:
```typescript
{
  currentRating: number | null;
  totalReviews: number;
  reviewBreakdown: {
    recent: number;    // 0-12 months
    medium: number;    // 13-24 months
    old: number;       // 25+ months
  };
  lastReviewDate: Date | null;
}
```

#### `getBulkUserAggregates(userIds: string[])`
**Purpose**: Processes multiple users efficiently for batch operations

**Use Cases**:
- System-wide rating updates
- Bulk user processing
- Performance optimization for large datasets

#### `cleanupOldAggregates(monthsOld: number)`
**Purpose**: Maintenance function to remove very old reviews

**Default**: Removes reviews older than 36 months
**Configurable**: Accepts custom month threshold

### Weighting Algorithm

#### Mathematical Formula
```
Weighted Average = (Recent_Sum × 0.6 + Medium_Sum × 0.3 + Old_Sum × 0.1) / Total_Weight
```

#### Example Calculation
```
User has 3 END_OF_LEASE reviews:
- Review 1: 5 stars, 6 months ago → Weight: 0.6, Contribution: 5 × 0.6 = 3.0
- Review 2: 4 stars, 18 months ago → Weight: 0.3, Contribution: 4 × 0.3 = 1.2
- Review 3: 3 stars, 30 months ago → Weight: 0.1, Contribution: 3 × 0.1 = 0.3

Total Weight = 0.6 + 0.3 + 0.1 = 1.0
Weighted Average = (3.0 + 1.2 + 0.3) / 1.0 = 4.5 stars
```

### Integration with Review Publisher

The aggregates service is automatically called by the Review Publisher Job:

1. **Review Published** → Status changes to `PUBLISHED`
2. **Aggregate Computation** → `computeUserAggregate(userId)` called
3. **User Update** → `averageRating` and `totalReviews` updated
4. **Rank Calculation** → `rankService.calculateUserRank()` called

### Performance Considerations

#### Database Queries
- **Optimized Queries**: Uses efficient Prisma queries with proper indexing
- **Selective Fields**: Only fetches necessary data for calculations
- **Ordered Results**: Reviews sorted by `publishedAt` for efficient processing

#### Caching Strategy
- **Real-time Updates**: Calculations performed immediately after review publishing
- **No Stale Data**: Always uses current review data
- **Efficient Processing**: Batch operations for multiple users

### Error Handling

#### Graceful Degradation
- **Individual Failures**: One user's failure doesn't affect others
- **Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- **Fallbacks**: Returns sensible defaults when calculations fail

#### Validation
- **User Existence**: Verifies user exists before processing
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures review data is valid and complete
- **Threshold Checking**: Validates minimum review requirements

### Testing

#### Test Coverage
```bash
# Run the test suite
node test-aggregates-service.js

# Test specific functions
node -e "
import { computeUserAggregate } from './src/services/reviews/aggregates.js';
computeUserAggregate('test-user-id');
"
```

#### Test Scenarios
- ✅ **Sufficient Reviews**: 3+ reviews with proper weighting
- ✅ **Insufficient Reviews**: <3 reviews returning null average
- ✅ **Time Weighting**: Different review ages with correct weights
- ✅ **Bulk Processing**: Multiple users processed efficiently
- ✅ **Edge Cases**: Empty data, invalid users, database errors

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables
```env
# Optional: Customize cleanup threshold
AGGREGATES_CLEANUP_MONTHS=36

# Optional: Enable debug logging
AGGREGATES_DEBUG=true
```

#### Weight Customization
```typescript

const WEIGHTS = {
  RECENT: 0.6,    // 0-12 months
  MEDIUM: 0.3,    // 13-24 months
  OLD: 0.1        // 25+ months
};
```

### Monitoring & Analytics

#### Key Metrics

## 🛡️ Content Moderation System

### Overview
The Content Moderation System automatically filters review text to ensure compliance with community guidelines. It prevents inappropriate content from being published while maintaining user privacy and providing clear feedback about content violations.

### Moderation Features

#### Content Filtering
- **Email Addresses**: Automatically detects and removes email addresses
- **Phone Numbers**: Identifies and blocks various phone number formats
- **URLs/Links**: Prevents sharing of external websites and links
- **Profanity**: Blocks inappropriate language and offensive terms
- **Hate Speech**: Detects discriminatory content and violent language

#### Moderation Process
1. **Text Analysis**: Reviews are automatically scanned before submission
2. **Content Detection**: Identifies violations using pattern matching and keyword detection
3. **Automatic Redaction**: Replaces violating content with placeholder text
4. **Status Update**: Sets review status to `BLOCKED` if violations are found
5. **T&S Queue**: Enqueues blocked content for manual review by Trust & Safety team

### Moderation Results

#### Response Format
```javascript
{
  ok: boolean,           // Whether content is acceptable
  redactedText: string,  // Text with violations replaced
  reasons: string[]      // List of violation reasons
}
```

#### Status Handling
- **`ok: true`** → Content is acceptable, review proceeds normally
- **`ok: false`** → Content violates guidelines, review is blocked

### Integration Points

#### Review Creation
- **Automatic Scanning**: All new reviews are moderated before creation

- **Role-Based Calculation**: Separate logic for tenants and landlords
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Review count, ratings, and dispute resolution
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Real-time trust level updates based on user activity
- **Dispute Integration**: Factors in dispute resolution rates and history

### Trust Level Tiers

#### 🆕 New Level
- **Criteria**: Less than 3 reviews
- **Score Range**: 0-40 points
- **Description**: New users who haven't established a track record yet
- **Benefits**: Basic platform access with standard features

#### 🔒 Reliable Level
- **Criteria**: 
  - 3+ reviews
  - Average rating ≥ 3.5 stars
  - Dispute rate < 20%
- **Score Range**: 40-70 points
- **Description**: Users with positive track records and minimal disputes
- **Benefits**: Enhanced platform features and priority support

#### 🥇 Trusted Level
- **Criteria**:
  - 10+ reviews
  - Average rating ≥ 4.2 stars
  - Dispute rate < 10%
- **Score Range**: 70-85 points
- **Description**: Highly reliable users with excellent track records
- **Benefits**: Premium features, faster response times, and trust badges

#### 🌟 Excellent Level
- **Criteria**:

  - Average rating ≥ 4.8 stars
  - 0 unresolved disputes
- **Score Range**: 85-100 points
- **Description**: Exceptional users with outstanding performance
- **Benefits**: VIP status, exclusive features, and platform ambassador opportunities

### Scoring Algorithm

#### Base Score Components
```
Total Score = Review Count Score + Rating Score - Dispute Penalty
```

**Review Count Score (0-40 points)**:
- Each review contributes 1.6 points
- Maximum of 40 points (25+ reviews)
- Formula: `Math.min(totalReviews * 1.6, 40)`

**Rating Score (0-40 points)**:
- Based on average rating from 1-5 stars
- Formula: `Math.max(0, (averageRating - 1) * 10)`
- 5.0 stars = 40 points, 1.0 star = 0 points

**Dispute Penalty (0-20 points deducted)**:
- Based on percentage of unresolved disputes
- Formula: `Math.min(20, disputeRate * 0.2)`
- 100% dispute rate = 20 point penalty

#### Example Calculations

**New User (2 reviews, 4.5 rating, 0 disputes)**:
- Review Score: 2 × 1.6 = 3.2 points
- Rating Score: (4.5 - 1) × 10 = 35 points
- Dispute Penalty: 0 points
- **Total Score**: 38.2 → **New Level**

**Reliable User (5 reviews, 4.0 rating, 10% dispute rate)**:
- Review Score: 5 × 1.6 = 8.0 points
- Rating Score: (4.0 - 1) × 10 = 30 points
- Dispute Penalty: 10% × 0.2 = 2.0 points
- **Total Score**: 36.0 → **Reliable Level**

**Trusted User (15 reviews, 4.5 rating, 5% dispute rate)**:
- Review Score: 15 × 1.6 = 24.0 points
- Rating Score: (4.5 - 1) × 10 = 35 points
- Dispute Penalty: 5% × 0.2 = 1.0 points
- **Total Score**: 58.0 → **Trusted Level**

### Service Functions

#### Tenant Trust Level Calculation
```javascript
import { tenantTrustLevel } from '../services/trustLevels.js';

const trustLevel = await tenantTrustLevel('user_123');

```jsx
import TrustLevelBadge from './TrustLevelBadge';

// Basic usage
<TrustLevelBadge level="Trusted" />

// With custom styling
<TrustLevelBadge level="Excellent" size="large" className="ml-2" />
```

### UI Integration Points

#### 1. Profile Pages (`frontend/src/pages/TenantProfile.jsx` and `frontend/src/pages/LandlordProfile.jsx`)
**Display Location**: Profile header, next to user name
**Purpose**: Show user's own trust level prominently
**Implementation**: Large badge displayed in the top-right corner of profile header

#### 2. Tenant Request Cards (`frontend/src/components/TenantRequestCard.jsx`)
**Display Location**: Next to tenant name in rental request cards
**Purpose**: Help landlords assess tenant reliability
**Implementation**: Small badge displayed next to tenant name and verification status

#### 3. Dashboard Integration
**Display Location**: Tenant dashboard and various user data displays
**Purpose**: Provide trust level context in user information displays
**Implementation**: Integrated into user data objects returned by backend APIs

### Backend Integration

#### API Endpoints
**New Endpoint**: `GET /api/users/:userId/trust-level`
- **Purpose**: Retrieve user trust level by ID
- **Access Control**: Users can view their own trust level, admins can view all
- **Response**: Trust level data with detailed metrics and reasons

**Enhanced Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Now includes `trustLevel` and `trustLevelDetails`
- `GET /api/rental-requests` - Tenant data includes `trustLevel`
- `GET /api/tenant-dashboard` - User data includes `trustLevel`

#### Data Flow
1. **User Action**: User accesses profile or rental requests
2. **Backend Calculation**: Trust level calculated using `trustLevels.js` service
3. **API Response**: Trust level included in user data payload
4. **Frontend Display**: TrustLevelBadge component renders with appropriate styling

### Trust Level Calculation Integration

#### User Controller (`backend/src/controllers/userController.js`)

## 🧪 Integration Tests

The review system includes comprehensive integration tests that verify all core functionality works correctly in various scenarios.

### Test Coverage

The integration tests cover all the requested review system functionalities:

#### 1. Both sides submit → instant publish
- **Test**: `should publish reviews immediately when both sides submit`
- **Description**: Verifies that when both tenant and landlord submit reviews for the same lease, they are published immediately instead of waiting for the 14-day timer.
- **Business Logic**: Ensures fair and timely review publication when both parties participate.

#### 2. One side submits → auto publish at +14d
- **Test**: `should auto-publish single review after 14 days`
- **Test**: `should not publish review before 14 days`
- **Description**: Ensures that single reviews are automatically published after 14 days, but not before.
- **Business Logic**: Prevents reviews from being stuck in pending state indefinitely while giving both parties time to respond.

#### 3. MOVE_IN visible but not counted in aggregates
- **Test**: `should make MOVE_IN reviews visible but exclude from aggregates`
- **Description**: Verifies that MOVE_IN stage reviews are visible to users but don't count toward user rating calculations and aggregates.
- **Business Logic**: Allows users to see move-in feedback without affecting their overall rating score.

#### 4. <3 reviews → "New" badge
- **Test**: `should show "New" badge for users with less than 3 reviews`
- **Test**: `should show "New" badge for users with no reviews`
- **Description**: Confirms that users with fewer than 3 reviews display a "New — verified, no reviews yet" badge instead of a rating.
- **Business Logic**: Provides clear indication of new users while preventing misleading ratings from insufficient data.

#### 5. Content moderation blocks PII
- **Test**: `should block reviews containing PII`
- **Test**: `should allow reviews without PII`
- **Test**: `should strip PII from reviews before submission`
- **Description**: Tests the content moderation service's ability to detect and handle personal identifiable information (PII) in review text.
- **Business Logic**: Protects user privacy and ensures compliance with data protection regulations.

#### 6. Trust levels resolve correctly
- **Test**: `should calculate correct trust levels based on review data`
- **Test**: `should handle new users with no reviews`
- **Test**: `should handle users with many positive reviews`
- **Description**: Verifies that the trust level service correctly calculates user trust levels based on review count, average rating, and other factors.
- **Business Logic**: Ensures accurate trust level assignment for user matching and reputation building.

#### 7. Badge calculation and assignment
- **Test**: `should calculate and assign badges correctly`
- **Description**: Tests the badge system's ability to calculate and assign badges based on user behavior and review data.
- **Business Logic**: Rewards positive behavior and provides gamification elements to encourage platform engagement.

#### 8. End-to-end review flow
- **Test**: `should handle complete review lifecycle`
- **Description**: Tests the complete review lifecycle from creation to publication to aggregation updates.
- **Business Logic**: Ensures the entire review system works cohesively from start to finish.

### Test Architecture
