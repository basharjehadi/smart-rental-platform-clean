# 🏠 Landlord Journey System - Smart Rental Platform

## 🎯 Overview
This document describes the complete Landlord Journey in the Smart Rental System, implementing a **reverse marketplace** where tenants submit requests and landlords compete to offer properties.

## 🚀 Core Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Availability Management**
- **No Manual Toggle**: Landlords don't need to manually set availability
- **Property-Based**: Availability is automatically derived from having available properties
- **Dynamic Updates**: Property status changes automatically update landlord availability

### 2. **5-Minute Delayed Matching**
- **Initial Delay**: New rental requests wait 5 minutes before matching starts
- **Continuous Scanning**: After 5 minutes, system continuously scans for new matches
- **Smart Timing**: Prevents immediate matching and allows for better competition

### 3. **Multiple Offers Per Property**
- **Competition Enabled**: Multiple landlords can offer on the same rental request
- **Same Property, Multiple Tenants**: Landlords can send offers to multiple tenants for the same property
- **First to Pay Wins**: System automatically handles competition and cleanup

### 4. **Request Pool Management**
- **Dynamic Expiration**: Requests expire 3 days before tenant's move-in date
- **Persistent Pool**: Declined requests remain active for other landlords
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Requests are removed only when paid or expired

## 🔄 Complete Landlord Journey Flow

### **Step 1: Account Creation & Property Listing**
```
Landlord Account Created → List Properties → Automatic Availability
```

**What Happens:**
- Landlord creates account
- Lists properties (automatically sets `availability: true`)
- System automatically marks landlord as available
- No manual availability toggle needed

### **Step 2: Request Matching (5-Minute Delay)**
```
Rental Request Created → Wait 5 Minutes → Start Matching → Continuous Scanning
```

**Timeline:**
- **0 minutes**: Request added to pool, no matching
- **5 minutes**: First matching cycle begins
- **Every 5 minutes**: Continuous matching for new properties/landlords
- **Until**: Request expires or tenant pays

### **Step 3: Landlord Sees Matches**
```
Dashboard → Rental Requests Page → Request Cards → Property-Linked Matches
```

**What Landlord Sees:**
- Each request card shows which property it's linked to
- Multiple requests can be linked to the same property
- No filtering - see all matching requests

### **Step 4: Send Offers**
```
Select Request → Send Offer → Multiple Tenants Per Property → Competition Enabled
```

**Offer Details:**
- Monthly rent amount
- Deposit amount
- Lease terms
- Additional rules
- Property details

**Competition Rules:**
- ✅ Multiple landlords can offer on same request
- ✅ Same landlord can offer to multiple tenants for same property
- ✅ First tenant to accept AND pay wins

### **Step 5: Tenant Response & Payment**
```
Tenant Accepts → Payment Required → First to Pay Wins → Automatic Cleanup
```

**What Happens:**
1. Tenant accepts offer
2. Other offers for same request are automatically rejected
3. Tenant completes payment
4. **ALL other offers for same property are automatically rejected**
5. Request removed from pool
6. Property marked as occupied

## 🏆 "First to Pay Wins" Competition System

### **Scenario 1: Multiple Landlords, Same Request**
```
Request A → Landlord 1 offers → Landlord 2 offers → Tenant accepts Landlord 1 → Payment → Landlord 2 offer rejected
```

### **Scenario 2: Same Landlord, Multiple Tenants, Same Property**
```
Property X → Offer to Tenant A → Offer to Tenant B → Tenant A pays first → Tenant B offer automatically rejected
```

### **Automatic Invalidation Logic:**
```javascript
// When payment succeeds:
1. Find all other offers for the same property
2. Reject all PENDING/ACCEPTED offers
3. Remove rental request from pool
4. Mark property as occupied
5. Send notifications to rejected tenants
```

## ⏰ Timing & Expiration System

### **Request Lifecycle:**
```
Created → 5min delay → Matching starts → Continuous matching → Expires (moveInDate - 3 days)
```

### **Expiration Triggers:**
- **Time-based**: 3 days before move-in date
- **Payment-based**: When tenant pays for accepted offer
- **Manual**: Landlord can decline (request stays in pool)

### **Notification System:**
- **Tenants**: Warned 2 days before expiration
- **Landlords**: Notified about expiring requests they're matched with
- **Rejection Notifications**: Both parties notified when offers are rejected

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Cron Jobs:**
```javascript
// Every 5 minutes: Continuous request matching
cron.schedule('*/5 * * * *', continuousRequestMatching);

// Daily: Cleanup and notifications
cron.schedule('0 2 * * *', dailyCleanup);
```

### **Key Functions:**
- `continuousRequestMatching()`: Handles delayed and continuous matching
- `sendExpirationNotifications()`: Warns about expiring requests
- `sendRejectionNotifications()`: Notifies about rejected offers
- `updateTenantOfferStatus()`: Manages offer acceptance/rejection
- `createOffer()`: Creates offers with competition tracking

### **Database Changes:**
- `LandlordRequestMatch.status`: Tracks match status (ACTIVE, DECLINED, RESPONDED)
- `Offer.status`: Tracks offer lifecycle (PENDING, ACCEPTED, REJECTED, PAID)
- `RentalRequest.poolStatus`: Manages pool lifecycle (ACTIVE, EXPIRED, MATCHED)
