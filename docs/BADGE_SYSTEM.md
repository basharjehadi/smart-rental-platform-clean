- **Responsiveness Badges**: Calculates average response times to messages

#### Database Schema
- **`UserBadge`**: Links users to earned badges with metadata
- **`Badge`**: Badge definitions and criteria
- **Automatic Updates**: Badge calculations run automatically when relevant data changes

### Frontend

#### Badge Component (`frontend/src/components/Badge.jsx`)
- **Interactive Tooltips**: Hover to see badge details
- **Color Schemes**: Different colors for different badge categories
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader friendly with proper titles

#### Badge Collection (`frontend/src/components/BadgeCollection.jsx`)

- **Smart Limiting**: Configurable maximum display with overflow indicators
- **Flexible Styling**: Customizable titles and appearance

## Integration Points

### User Profile Page
- **Header Display**: Shows top badges in horizontal layout
- **Dedicated Section**: Full achievements section with grid layout
- **Real-time Updates**: Badges update automatically when earned

### Tenant Request Cards
- **Quick Overview**: Shows first 3 badges in compact layout
- **Landlord Decision Support**: Helps landlords assess tenant reliability
- **Performance Indicators**: Visual representation of tenant achievements

### API Endpoints
- **`GET /users/profile`**: Returns user data including badges
- **`GET /users/:userId/badges`**: Get badges for specific user
- **Automatic Calculation**: Badges calculated on-demand

## Badge Earning Criteria

### Perfect Payer Badge
1. User must have at least one payment in the last 12 months
